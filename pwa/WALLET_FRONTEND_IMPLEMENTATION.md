    // ... other reducers
    wallet: walletSlice,
  },

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Wallet account not found"
**Solution:** Member doesn't have a wallet account. Admin needs to create one with `savings_product.type = 'wallet'`

### "Insufficient balance"
**Solution:** Top up wallet before attempting withdrawal or payment

### "API call failed"
**Solution:** Check:
- Laravel backend is running
- API routes are registered
- Authentication token is valid
- CORS is configured

### Balance not updating
**Solution:**
- Click refresh button on wallet card
- Refresh the page
- Check Redux DevTools for state updates

---

## 📝 Code Examples

### Using Wallet in a New Component

```typescript
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { fetchWalletBalance, topupWallet } from '@/store/walletSlice';

function MyComponent() {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const { balance, loading } = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.wallet);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    dispatch(fetchWalletBalance(walletAccountId));
  }, []);
  
  const handleTopup = async () => {
    await dispatch(topupWallet({
      member_id: 1,
      account_id: 5,
      amount: 10000,
      description: 'Top-up'
    }));
  };
  
  return (
    <div>
      Balance: {balance?.balance}
      <button onClick={handleTopup}>Top-up</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
