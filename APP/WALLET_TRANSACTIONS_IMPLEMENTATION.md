## Configuration Settings

Located in `config/sacco.php`:

```php
'wallet_minimum_transaction' => 500,        // Minimum transaction amount
'wallet_daily_limit' => 5000000,           // Daily transaction limit
'wallet_transaction_limit' => 1000000,     // Single transaction limit
'wallet_minimum_balance' => 0,             // Minimum balance (usually 0 for wallets)
'wallet_transfer_fee' => 0,                // Transfer fee (currently 0)
```

## Database Changes

### Migration Created
`2025_10_22_163012_add_wallet_transaction_types_to_transactions_table.php`

**Run Migration:**
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

This adds the following transaction types to the `transactions.type` enum:
- `wallet_topup`
- `wallet_withdrawal`
- `wallet_to_savings`
- `wallet_to_loan`

## Files Created/Modified

### Created Files:
1. `app/Services/Transactions/WalletTransactionHandler.php` (291 lines)
2. `app/Http/Controllers/Api/Transactions/WalletTransactionController.php` (302 lines)
3. `database/migrations/2025_10_22_163012_add_wallet_transaction_types_to_transactions_table.php`

### Modified Files:
1. `app/Services/TransactionService.php` - Registered wallet handlers
2. `app/Services/BalanceService.php` - Added wallet balance logic
3. `app/Services/ValidationService.php` - Added wallet validation
4. `routes/api.php` - Added wallet routes
5. `config/sacco.php` - Added wallet configuration

---

## Transaction Flow

```
1. Request → WalletTransactionController
2. Validation → Request rules + DTO validation
3. TransactionService → processTransaction()
4. WalletTransactionHandler → validate()
5. DB Transaction BEGIN
6. Create Transaction record
7. Execute handler logic
8. Update wallet balance (BalanceService with row locking)
9. Create ledger entries (LedgerService)
10. Verify double-entry balance
11. DB Transaction COMMIT
12. Fire TransactionProcessed event
```

---

## Security Features

✅ **Row-Level Locking** - Prevents concurrent balance updates
✅ **Daily Limits** - Configurable transaction limits
✅ **Member Status Validation** - Only active members can transact
✅ **Account Status Validation** - Only active accounts allowed
✅ **Minimum Amount Validation** - Prevents micro-transactions
✅ **Sufficient Balance Checks** - For withdrawals and transfers
✅ **Authentication Required** - All endpoints protected
✅ **Authorization Gates** - Permission-based access control

---

## Business Rules Implemented

1. **Minimum Transaction**: 500 UGX (configurable)
2. **Daily Limit**: 5,000,000 UGX (configurable)
3. **No Fees**: Wallet transactions are currently fee-free
4. **No Minimum Balance**: Wallets can go to zero
5. **Instant Processing**: All transactions process immediately
6. **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history maintained
7. **Reversible**: Transactions can be reversed by authorized staff

---

## Loan Repayment Logic

When using wallet to repay loans, the system:
1. **First pays interest** - Deducts from interest balance
2. **Then pays principal** - Remaining amount goes to principal
3. **Updates loan status** - Marks as "completed" when fully paid
4. **Creates proper entries** - Separate ledger entries for interest and principal

---

## Testing the Implementation

### Step 1: Run Migration
```bash
cd APP
php artisan migrate
```

### Step 2: Create a Wallet Account
Ensure you have a savings product with `type = 'wallet'` and create an account for a member.

### Step 3: Test Endpoints with Postman/API Client

**Example: Top-up Wallet**
```bash
POST http://your-domain/api/wallet/topup
Authorization: Bearer {your-token}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "member_id": 1,
  "account_id": 5,
  "amount": 10000,
  "description": "Initial wallet funding"
}
```

### Step 4: Verify in Database

**Check Transaction:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE type = 'wallet_topup' ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1;
```

**Check Ledger Entries:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM general_ledger 
WHERE reference_type = 'Transaction' 
  AND reference_id = {transaction_id}
ORDER BY id;
```

**Verify Balance:**
```sql
-- Should show Debit = Credit
SELECT 
  SUM(debit_amount) as total_debits,
  SUM(credit_amount) as total_credits
FROM general_ledger 
WHERE reference_type = 'Transaction' 
  AND reference_id = {transaction_id};
```

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Mobile Money Integration** - MTN, Airtel connectivity
2. **QR Code Payments** - Generate QR codes for wallet accounts
3. **P2P Transfers** - Member-to-member wallet transfers
4. **Scheduled Transfers** - Auto-transfer from wallet to savings
5. **Real-time Notifications** - SMS/Email alerts for transactions
6. **Transaction Limits by Member Type** - Different limits for different member categories
7. **Wallet Statements** - PDF generation for wallet transactions

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Invalid transaction type"
**Solution:** Run the migration to add wallet types to the enum.

### Issue: "Insufficient balance"
**Solution:** Ensure the wallet account has sufficient funds before withdrawal/transfer.

### Issue: "This is not a wallet account"
**Solution:** Verify the account's `savings_product.type` is set to 'wallet'.

### Issue: "Daily limit exceeded"
**Solution:** Check `wallet_daily_limit` in config or wait until the next day.
