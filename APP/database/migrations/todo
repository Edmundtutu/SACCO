>>Accounts type enhancement: 
  Due to variations in the types of accounts (savings, loans, shares),
  we need to adapt the accounts creation to a robust way of handling different account types.
>> Aproach: 
    1. Create migrations for the different indiviaul type entities i.e. savings_account table, loan_account table, share_account table, etc.
    2. Add a morphmany relationship on the account model to be linked to the different account types.
    3. Make sure to update the account creation process to handle the different account types.
    4. Apprehend the changes through out all dependencies including the factories and seeders!
