### 2. **Authentication & Authorization**
- **JWT-based authentication** using tymon/jwt-auth
- **Role-based access control** (Member, Admin, Staff, Loan Officer, Accountant)
- **Member registration** with KYC information
- **Profile management** with approval workflow

### 3. **Savings Management**
- **Multiple savings products** (Compulsory, Voluntary, Fixed Deposit)
- **Account management** with proper balance tracking
- **Deposit/Withdrawal operations** with fees

### 4. **Financial System**
- **Double-entry bookkeeping** with General Ledger

## üöÄ API Usage Examples

### Authentication

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "admin@sacco.com", "password": "password123"}'

# Register Member
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "password_confirmation": "password123",
    "phone": "+1234567890",
    "national_id": "ID123456",
    ...
  }'
```

### Savings Operations
```bash
# Make Deposit
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/savings/deposit \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "account_id": 1,
    "amount": 5000,
    "payment_method": "cash",

  }'

# Get Accounts
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/savings/accounts \

## üìà Business Logic Implemented

### Membership Workflow
1. Member registers online
2. Admin reviews and approves/rejects  
3. Approved member can open accounts
4. Member starts saving and becomes eligible for loans

### Savings Workflow
1. Member opens account with specific product
2. Makes deposits with various payment methods
3. Earns interest based on product terms
4. Can withdraw subject to product rules and fees

### Transaction Processing
1. All transactions create double-entry GL postings
2. Account balances updated in real-time
3. Fee calculations and deductions
4. Complete audit trail maintained

## üéØ Ready for Extension

The system architecture is designed for easy extension:

### Loan Management (Architecture Ready)

- Guarantorship system
- Approval and disbursement
- Repayment scheduling
- Penalty calculation
