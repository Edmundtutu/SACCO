### Membership Workflow

2. Admin reviews and approves/rejects
3. Approved member can open accounts
4. Member starts saving and becomes eligible for loans

### Savings Workflow  
1. Member opens account with specific product
2. Makes deposits (cash, bank transfer, mobile money)
3. Earns interest based on product terms
4. Can withdraw subject to product rules

### Loan Workflow (Planned)
1. Member applies for loan with guarantors
2. System validates eligibility (savings history, guarantors)
3. Loan committee reviews and approves
4. Loan is disbursed to member account
5. Member makes scheduled repayments
6. System tracks penalties for late payments
