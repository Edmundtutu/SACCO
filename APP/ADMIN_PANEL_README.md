```

### Routes
All admin routes are prefixed with `/admin` and protected by authentication middleware:

- `GET /admin/login` - Admin login form
- `POST /admin/login` - Process login
- `GET /admin/dashboard` - Main dashboard
- `GET /admin/members` - Member management
- `GET /admin/savings` - Savings management
- `GET /admin/loans` - Loans management
- `GET /admin/shares` - Shares management
- `GET /admin/reports` - Reports interface

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Dependencies
Ensure your Laravel application has the following:
- Laravel 9+ with Blade templating
- Bootstrap 5 (loaded via CDN)
- jQuery for enhanced interactions
- Chart.js for dashboard analytics

### 2. Middleware Registration
The `AdminMiddleware` is already registered in `app/Http/Kernel.php`:
```php
protected $routeMiddleware = [
    // ... other middleware
    'admin' => \App\Http\Middleware\AdminMiddleware::class,
];
```

### 3. Database Requirements
Ensure your users table has the following columns:
- `role` (enum: 'member', 'admin', 'staff', 'loan_officer', 'accountant')
- `status` (enum: 'pending', 'active', 'suspended', 'inactive')
- Other member-related fields as defined in the User model

### 4. Assets
The admin panel uses:
- Bootstrap 5.3.0 (CDN)
- Bootstrap Icons (CDN)
- DataTables for enhanced table functionality
- Chart.js for dashboard charts
- Custom CSS (`/css/admin.css`)

### 5. User Roles
Create admin users with appropriate roles:
```php
// Example admin user creation
User::create([
    'name' => 'Admin User',
    'email' => 'admin@sacco.com',
    'password' => Hash::make('password'),
    'role' => 'admin',
    'status' => 'active',
]);
```

## Usage Guide

### Accessing the Admin Panel
1. Navigate to `/admin/login`
2. Login with admin credentials
3. Users with roles: admin, staff, loan_officer, or accountant can access

### Dashboard Navigation
- **Sidebar**: Main navigation with active state indicators
- **Top Bar**: User profile dropdown with logout option
- **Quick Actions**: Frequently used functions
- **Statistics Cards**: Key performance indicators

### Member Management
1. **View Members**: Search, filter by status, pagination
2. **Approve Members**: Single-click approval for pending members
3. **Edit Details**: Update member information and status
4. **Account Management**: Suspend/activate member accounts

### Transaction Processing
1. **Manual Transactions**: Process deposits/withdrawals manually
2. **Transaction History**: Monitor all savings activities
3. **Account Monitoring**: Real-time balance tracking

### Loan Processing
1. **Application Review**: View loan applications with member details
2. **Approval Workflow**: Approve → Disburse → Monitor
3. **Portfolio Management**: Track loan performance

### Reporting
1. **Quick Reports**: Generate reports with date ranges
2. **Export Options**: Web view, PDF download, Excel export
3. **Financial Statements**: Trial balance, balance sheet

## Customization

### Styling
The admin panel uses a custom color scheme defined in `/css/admin.css`:
- Primary Color: `#3399CC` (SACCO brand blue)
- Success: `#28a745`
- Warning: `#ffc107`
- Danger: `#dc3545`

### Adding New Features
1. Create controller in `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/`
2. Add routes in `routes/web.php` within admin group
3. Create views in `resources/views/admin/`
4. Update navigation in `layouts/app.blade.php`

### Permission System
Extend the `AdminMiddleware` to implement more granular permissions:
```php
// Example: Check specific permissions
if (!$user->hasPermission('manage_loans')) {
    abort(403, 'Insufficient permissions');
}
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: All admin routes protected by middleware
2. **CSRF Protection**: All forms include CSRF tokens
3. **Role Verification**: Middleware checks user roles
4. **Session Security**: Automatic session regeneration on login
5. **Input Validation**: Server-side validation on all forms

## Performance Features

1. **Pagination**: Large datasets are paginated (20-50 items per page)
2. **Lazy Loading**: Related models loaded only when needed
3. **Caching**: Consider implementing caching for reports
4. **Database Indexing**: Ensure proper indexes on search fields

## Browser Support

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **403 Errors**: Check user role and middleware configuration
2. **CSS Not Loading**: Verify asset paths and public directory
3. **Routes Not Found**: Run `php artisan route:cache`
4. **Login Issues**: Check database user roles and status

### Debug Mode
Enable Laravel debugging for development:
```php
// .env
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Permissions**: Implement granular permission system
2. **Audit Logs**: Track all admin actions
3. **Multi-language**: Add internationalization support
4. **API Integration**: Connect with external services
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Enhanced mobile responsiveness
6. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live updates
